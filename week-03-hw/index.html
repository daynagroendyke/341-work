<hr /><h1>A Place in the Country<h1/>
      <h2>By: Toi Derricotte, 1941<h2/>
      <p><h3>  We like the houses here.<br />
  We circle the lake turning<br />
  into dark cleavages, dense-packed gleamings.<br />
  We could live here, we say.<br />
  We’re smiling, but thinking<br />
  of the houses at the last resort:<br />
  The real estate agent looked surprised<br />
  when she saw Bruce’s face; then flipped<br />
  quickly through the glossy pictures—<br />
  I’m sure you won’t like this one;<br />
  I can tell it’s not your kind.<br />
  Our house in Essex Fells<br />
  took a year to sell and sold<br />
  to a black family. A friend explained,<br />
  once a house is owned<br />
  by black people, they’re the only ones<br />
  they’ll show it to. Do we want to live<br />
  some place with a view<br />
  overlooking the politics?<br />
  When we pass<br />
  an exit named “Negro Mountain,”<br />
  Bruce smiles and jerks the wheel<br />
  as if we almost missed our turn.<br />
  Why must everything we want<br />
  come by stealth? Why is every road<br />
  in this bright country furnished<br />
  with its history of hatred? Yet<br />
  we keep smiling, driven<br />
  by a desire beyond the logic<br />
  of if we can afford it,<br />
  and whether we would love<br />
  or hate it if we did buy.</p></h3>
